# Effective Java 3rd examples
* This repo contains examples illustrating items described in Effective Java (3rd Edition) by Joshua Bloch.
* Examples are based on code from the book, but they are not direct copy of them.
* They are just a result of my walk through the book examples. It's not enough to read something you always should write code by yourself  :wink:
* Examples can and probably contains errors and bugs. Sometimes intentionally, e.g. use of deprecated or incorect methods, objects and patterns.
